# uxbenka-river-water-supply
GRASS GIS code and a starting SRTM DEM and watershed extent to analyze hydroclimatic impacts on human occupation at Uxbenk√°

In particular, the supplied code computes and plots:
* Statistics of plazuela distances to defined river features based on flow accumulation
* Similarly developed buffer extents to determine the fractional watershed area near rivers that are usable as water sources

Topographic data as well as the area (polygon) defining the Rio Blanco watershed are included, but household site (Plazuela) data are omitted due to security concerns surrounding their sensitive and irreplaceable culutural history.
